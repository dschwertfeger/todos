This is a simple Todo List application which I'm building to learn Backbone's 
conventions based on the exercises in [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/blog/ "Blog")'s book
[Developing Backbone.js Applications](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/).

"Itâ€™s a relatively simple application, yet technical challenges surrounding binding, persisting model data, routing, and template rendering provide opportunities to illustrate some core Backbone features." [Osmani 2013]
